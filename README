for information about how to use Net::PSYC have a look at the pod included
in the source-files. (perldoc PSYC.pm)

even though this library is rather stable.. it should still be considered beta 
since the API may change in future releases (I will try to avoid that, really). 

INSTALL:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

if you dont have 'make' just copy the following files like this:

    PSYC.pm        => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC.pm
    PSYC/Circuit.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Circuit.pm
    PSYC/Datagram.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Datagram.pm
    PSYC/Event.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Event.pm
    PSYC/State.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/State.pm
    PSYC/Event/Event.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Event/Event.pm
    PSYC/Event/IO_Select.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Event/IO_Select.pm
    PSYC/Event/Gtk2.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Event/Gtk2.pm
    PSYC/Storage.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Storage.pm
    PSYC/Client.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Client.pm
    PSYC/Tie/AbbrevHash.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Tie/AbbrevHash.pm
    PSYC/Tie/File.pm => perl-path/site/lib/Net/PSYC/Tie/File.pm
